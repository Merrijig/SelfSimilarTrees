Order 1:
    RULED OUT: general linear, basic quadratic, exp(x^2)
    DEFINITELY POSSIBLE: exponential, constant (probably the only things that are possible... including average exponential)

    CONJECTURE: Asymptotically, the ratio depends only on the depth and number of the self-reference nodes (i.e. ignores the stems that place them, and the non self-reference nodes)

Order 2:
    MARRIED TREES 1:
        F_n = S_{n-3} + 3 (WHAT THE HELL???)
        This offset self-reference seems characteristic of order 2 sequences (probably especially married sequences)
        Let's consider a sequence with the 2-rule:
            F: 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34
            S: 1, 3, 6, 11, 19, 32
        Fibonacci... I was wrong... (tbf, it's Fibonacci excludng the first element)
        Perfectly capture by the tree "JoshMarriedCore1" which has order 1
        This is so beautiful... so lucky I found it
